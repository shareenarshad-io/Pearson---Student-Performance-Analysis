# Pearson---Student-Performance-Analysis
Pearson Data Science Project

The purpose of this project is to delve into student data to uncover insights that could help understand and predict student success across different academic periods. As a contributor, you will explore the relationship between student grades and a myriad of demographic, social, and school-related factors. Your analysis will directly impact our ability to identify and address key influences on student performance.

The project aims to complete these goals. 

UPDATE: Missing dataset, on hold onto dataset found.
