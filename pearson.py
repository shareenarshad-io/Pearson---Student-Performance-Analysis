Final Insights
Actionable Insights
School Support: Significant positive impact on Mathematics grades suggests that strengthening school support services could enhance student performance.
Romantic Relationships The significant association with grades in Mathematics implies the need for guidance and counseling services that help students balance personal life with academic demands.
Statistical Significance:
The Chi-Square Tests revealed significant relationships in specific areas, notably in the influence of school support and romantic relationships on Mathematics grades, and the impact of family educational background on Portuguese language grades.
Recommendations
Enhance School Support: Schools should consider expanding their support services, focusing on academic counseling and tutoring, especially for Mathematics.
Counseling Services: Implement programs that offer guidance on managing personal relationships alongside academic responsibilities.
Parental Involvement: Encourage parental involvement, especially in households with a lower educational background, to positively influence studentsâ€™ performance in Portuguese language.
Future Research
Longitudinal Studies: To better understand the long-term effects of these factors on academic performance.
Qualitative Research: Interviews and focus groups with students could provide deeper insights into the impact of personal and social factors on their academic life.
Comparative Studies Comparing these findings with other educational systems or age groups could offer a broader perspective on the influence of these factors on student achievement.
These insights and recommendations aim to contribute to the development of more effective educational strategies and support systems, ultimately enhancing student performance and well-being.
